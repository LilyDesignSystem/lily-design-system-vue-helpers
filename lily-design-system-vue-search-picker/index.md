# SearchPicker (Vue helper)

A headless Vue 3 site-search control: a single-icon button (a bundled
magnifying-glass SVG) that opens a dropdown holding a search field and,
at its right, a submit button labelled `⏎`. Pressing Return in the field,
or the `⏎` button, navigates to `/?<query>` — a search for `foo` goes to
`/?foo`.

A port of the canonical
[`@lilydesignsystem/svelte-search-picker`](../../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/lily-design-system-svelte-search-picker/).
The single source of truth is [spec/index.md](./spec/index.md). This file
is the human-readable guide.

## Install

```ts
import { SearchPicker, searchHref } from "@lilydesignsystem/vue-search-picker";
```

## Quick start

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import SearchPicker from "@lilydesignsystem/vue-search-picker";
</script>

<template>
  <SearchPicker
    label="Search this site"
    input-label="Search terms"
    submit-label="Search"
  />
</template>
```

That is the whole wiring: a search for `foo` performs a GET to `/?foo`.

## Where the search goes

The destination is `searchHref(query, action)`:

| You type     | `action`    | Destination   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| `foo`        | `"/"`       | `/?foo`       |
| `  foo bar ` | `"/"`       | `/?foo%20bar` |
| `a&b`        | `"/"`       | `/?a%26b`     |
| `foo`        | `"/search"` | `/search?foo` |

The query is trimmed and URI-encoded, so spaces and `&` cannot split or
corrupt it. An empty query goes nowhere.

The bare query (`/?foo`, not `/?q=foo`) is why the component navigates
in script: a native GET form always sends `name=value` pairs, so it
cancels the native submission and navigates to the exact URL itself.

## Client-side routing

By default the component calls `location.assign(href)` — a real GET
request. In a single-page app, pass your router's navigate function so
the search stays in-app:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useRouter } from "vue-router";
import SearchPicker from "@lilydesignsystem/vue-search-picker";

const router = useRouter();
</script>

<template>
  <SearchPicker
    label="Search this site"
    input-label="Search terms"
    submit-label="Search"
    :navigate="(href) => router.push(href)"
  />
</template>
```

The `search` event (`@search="(query, href) => …"`) fires before
navigating, for analytics or to record the query.

## Props, events, slot

Full table in [spec/index.md §4.1](./spec/index.md#41-props). Required:
`label`, `inputLabel`, `submitLabel` — no English defaults, because every
user-facing string is yours to localise. Optional: `placeholder`,
`value` (`v-model:value`), `action`, `navigate`, `class`.

Events: `search(query, href)` and `update:value(value)`. The default
scoped slot replaces the icon and receives `{ open, query }`.

## Accessibility

- The icon is `aria-hidden`; the button's name comes from `label`.
- The dropdown is a real `<form role="search">` — a search landmark named
  by `label` — with a real `type="search"` field and `type="submit"`
  button, so Return-to-submit and mobile search keyboards just work.
- `⏎` is the visible label only: it is `aria-hidden`, and the submit
  button's name is `submitLabel`.
- Opening focuses the field; `Escape` closes and returns focus to the
  button; clicking outside or tabbing away closes.
- See [docs/accessibility.md](./docs/accessibility.md) for the tradeoffs.

## Styling

Class hooks: `.search-picker` (root), `.search-picker-button`,
`.search-picker-icon`, `.search-picker-panel`, `.search-picker-form`,
`.search-picker-input`, `.search-picker-submit`,
`.search-picker-submit-symbol`.

The package ships no CSS beyond the icon markup.

## Tests

`npx vitest run lily-design-system-vue-search-picker` from the catalog
root — 24 cases, one per §7 clause.
