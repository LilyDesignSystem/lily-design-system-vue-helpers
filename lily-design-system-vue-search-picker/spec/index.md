# SearchPicker — Specification

Single source of truth for the `@lilydesignsystem/vue-search-picker`
Vue 3 helper. A port of the canonical
[`@lilydesignsystem/svelte-search-picker`](../../../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/lily-design-system-svelte-search-picker/spec/index.md);
when the two disagree, the Svelte side wins.

This file drives implementation, testing, and documentation:
anything not in this spec is out of scope; anything in this spec must be
exercised by a test.

Sibling files:

- `SearchPicker.vue` — the implementation (`<script setup lang="ts">`)
- `SearchPicker.test.ts` — vitest spec exercising every clause in §7
- `index.ts` — re-export barrel
- `index.md` — user-facing guide

## 1. Goal

Give a Vue 3 application a drop-in, headless site-search control that:

1. Renders a single-icon button (a bundled magnifying-glass SVG) matching
   the other Lily page-header helpers.
2. Opens a dropdown holding a search text field and, at its right, a
   submit button whose visible label is `⏎` (U+23CE RETURN SYMBOL).
3. On Return in the field, or on activating the submit button, performs
   a GET navigation to `/?<query>` — searching for `foo` goes to `/?foo`.
4. Ships zero CSS.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Running the search.** The control only navigates; the page at
  `/?<query>` (or a custom `action`) does the searching.
- **Suggestions, autocomplete, or a results list.** This is a field and a
  submit button, not a combobox. A typeahead would need a listbox of
  results the component has no source for.
- **Persistence.** There is no preference to remember. Nothing is written
  to `localStorage`.
- **A named query parameter.** The contract is the bare query string
  (`/?foo`), not `/?q=foo`; see §3.

## 3. Architectural decisions

- **A helper that owns an action, like `share-picker`.** It applies
  nothing to the document and persists nothing; it is a helper because it
  owns a complete interaction end to end and ships the same headless
  contract. See `AGENTS/helpers.md`.
- **A disclosure holding a real `<form role="search">`, not a menu.** The
  popup is a native form: a `type="search"` field and a `type="submit"`
  button, so Return-to-submit, mobile "search" keyboards and form
  semantics all come from the platform. The form is a search landmark,
  named by `label`.
- **The bare query, so navigation is done in script.** A native GET form
  submission always sends `name=value` pairs (`/?q=foo`). The contract is
  `/?foo`, so the component cancels the native submission and navigates
  to `searchHref(query, action)` itself. The form keeps
  `action`/`method="get"` so its semantics stay truthful.
- **Encoded and trimmed.** The query is `trim()`med and passed through
  `encodeURIComponent`, so `foo bar` goes to `/?foo%20bar` and `a&b` to
  `/?a%26b` rather than producing a malformed or split query. An empty or
  whitespace-only query navigates nowhere.
- **`navigate` is overridable.** The default is `location.assign(href)`,
  a real GET request. Single-page apps pass their router's navigate
  function (e.g. `(href) => router.push(href)` with Vue Router) to stay
  client-side.
- **`⏎` is the visible label, never the accessible name.** It renders in
  an `aria-hidden` span; the button's name is the required `submitLabel`,
  because a screen reader announcing "return symbol" names a key, not
  the action. Likewise `label` and `inputLabel` are required with no
  English default — see `AGENTS/internationalization.md`.

## 4. Public API

### 4.1 Props

| Prop          | Type                              | Required | Default                | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`       | `string`                          | yes      | —                      | Accessible name for the icon button and the search landmark.   |
| `inputLabel`  | `string`                          | yes      | —                      | Accessible name for the search field.                          |
| `submitLabel` | `string`                          | yes      | —                      | Accessible name for the `⏎` submit button.                     |
| `placeholder` | `string`                          | no       | `undefined`            | Placeholder for the field. No default (it would be English).   |
| `value`       | `string` (`v-model:value`)        | no       | `""`                   | The search text.                                               |
| `action`      | `string`                          | no       | `"/"`                  | Path the query is appended to: `${action}?${query}`.           |
| `navigate`    | `(href: string) => void`          | no       | `location.assign`      | Performs the navigation.                                       |
| `class`       | `string`                          | no       | `""`                   | Extra class on the root.                                       |
| other attrs   | any HTML attributes               | no       | —                      | Fall through onto the root `<div>` (Vue's single-root fallthrough). |

### 4.1a Events and slot

| Event          | Payload                         | Purpose                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search`       | `(query: string, href: string)` | Fires with the trimmed query and destination, before navigating. The Svelte canonical's `onSearch` callback prop; an `onSearch` prop still works, since Vue maps it to this declared event. |
| `update:value` | `(value: string)`               | Fires as the field is typed into; drives `v-model:value`.        |

The default scoped slot replaces the button icon and receives `SlotArgs`
(`ChildArgs` is an alias matching the Svelte type name) — the Svelte
canonical's `children` snippet.

`navigate` stays a prop rather than becoming an event: it is not a
notification but the action itself, and the component needs its
`location.assign` default when nobody supplies one.

```ts
type SlotArgs = { open: boolean; query: string };
type ChildArgs = SlotArgs;
```

### 4.2 DOM contract

```html
<div class="search-picker {class}">
  <button
    type="button"
    class="search-picker-button"
    aria-label="{label}"
    aria-expanded
    aria-controls="{panelId}"
  >
    <svg class="search-picker-icon" viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.6" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" width="1.05rem" height="1.05rem"><circle cx="7" cy="7" r="4.5"/><path d="M10.5 10.5 14 14"/></svg>
  </button>
  <div class="search-picker-panel" id="{panelId}" hidden>
    <form class="search-picker-form" role="search" aria-label="{label}" action="{action}" method="get">
      <input class="search-picker-input" type="search" aria-label="{inputLabel}" placeholder="{placeholder}" enterkeyhint="search" />
      <button type="submit" class="search-picker-submit" aria-label="{submitLabel}">
        <span class="search-picker-submit-symbol" aria-hidden="true">⏎</span>
      </button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

The submit button follows the field in DOM order, so it sits at the
field's right in left-to-right layouts (and at its left under
`dir="rtl"`, as it should). Its placement is consumer CSS.

### 4.3 Re-exports

`index.ts` exports `default`, `SearchPicker`, `RETURN_SYMBOL` (the bare
`⏎` character), `searchHref`, `nextSearchPickerId`, and the types `Props`,
`SlotArgs`, and `ChildArgs`.

## 5. Behaviour

### 5.1 Searching

Return in the field or activating the submit button submits the form. The
component cancels the native submission, trims the query, and — when it
is non-empty — emits `search(query, href)`, closes the panel, and calls
`navigate(href)` (default `location.assign(href)`), where
`href = searchHref(query, action)`. An empty or whitespace-only query
does nothing and leaves the panel open.

### 5.2 Keyboard

| Key               | On the icon button                      | In the panel                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Opens (or closes) the panel             | In the field: `Enter` searches. On ⏎: searches. |
| `Escape`          | —                                       | Closes and returns focus to the icon button    |
| `Tab`             | Moves on                                | Native order: field → ⏎ → out, which closes    |

Opening moves focus into the search field. Clicking outside, or focus
moving to an element outside the root, closes the panel without moving
focus. A focusout with no `relatedTarget` does **not** close it: Safari
does not focus a `<button>` on click, so pressing `⏎` (or the icon
button) blurs the field with no new focus target, and closing there
would hide the panel before the click lands. Every focus move
the component makes on its own passes `{ preventScroll: true }`.

## 6. Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AAA target. The icon is `aria-hidden`; the button's accessible
name is `label`. The form is a search landmark (`role="search"`) named by
`label`; the field is named by `inputLabel`; the submit button by
`submitLabel`, with `⏎` hidden from assistive technology. All three names
are consumer-supplied and localisable.

Known costs, stated rather than glossed: the trigger's name rests
entirely on `aria-label`, with no visible text fallback; and `⏎` as the
only visible submit label assumes the symbol is understood, which is why
the accessible name never relies on it.

## 7. Testing acceptance criteria

`SearchPicker.test.ts` asserts every clause below (vitest +
`@vue/test-utils`, jsdom).

1. Renders a `<button class="search-picker-button">` named by `label`, with `aria-expanded="false"` and `aria-controls` naming the panel.
2. The panel is hidden until the button is activated; activating opens it (`aria-expanded="true"`), activating again closes it.
3. The default icon is an `aria-hidden` SVG `.search-picker-icon`.
4. The default slot replaces the icon and receives `SlotArgs` (`open`, `query`).
5. The panel holds a `<form role="search">` named by `label`, a `type="search"` field named by `inputLabel`, and a `type="submit"` button named by `submitLabel` after the field.
6. The submit button's visible content is `⏎` in an `aria-hidden` span.
7. Opening focuses the search field with `{ preventScroll: true }`.
8. Pressing Return in the field (submitting the form) navigates to `/?<query>`: `foo` → `/?foo`, and the native form submission is cancelled.
9. Clicking the submit button navigates the same way.
10. The query is trimmed and URI-encoded: `  foo bar ` → `/?foo%20bar`, `a&b` → `/?a%26b`.
11. An empty or whitespace-only query does not navigate and leaves the panel open.
12. `action` changes the path: `action="/search"` sends `foo` to `/search?foo`.
13. The `search` event (and an `onSearch` prop) fires with the trimmed query and the href, before `navigate`.
14. Without `navigate`, the default calls `location.assign(href)`.
15. A search closes the panel.
16. `Escape` closes the panel and returns focus to the button with `{ preventScroll: true }`.
17. Clicking outside closes the panel.
18. Focus moving to an element outside the root closes the panel.
19. An initial `value` pre-fills the field, typing emits `update:value`, and a value written back by the parent reaches the field.
20. `searchHref()` builds the same destination the component navigates to.
21. `RETURN_SYMBOL` is the bare `⏎` (U+23CE).
22. `class` is appended to `search-picker` on the root, and other attributes fall through onto the root.
23. The component renders no user-facing text of its own: with no `placeholder` the field has none, and the only text node is the `aria-hidden` `⏎`.
24. A focusout with no `relatedTarget` (Safari's click on `⏎` or on the icon button, a window blur) leaves the panel open, so the click that caused it still lands.
