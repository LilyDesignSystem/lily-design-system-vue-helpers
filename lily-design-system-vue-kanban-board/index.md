# KanbanBoard (Vue helper)

A reusable Vue 3 headless **interactive kanban board**. It composes
`@lilydesignsystem/vue-headless`'s `KanbanTable` family — the same
`role="grid"` container the headless catalog ships, with zero
behaviour built in — and the same `IconButton`/`Listbox` pair every
Vue picker helper already depends on, reused here as a per-card "Move
to…" action menu. Ships no CSS: every visual detail is the consumer's,
via kebab-case class hooks.

Cards move between columns two ways, deliberately never drag-only:
pointer drag-and-drop, and a keyboard-accessible move menu. Native
drag-and-drop fails WCAG 2.5.7 (Dragging Movements); the research
behind this package (see [spec/index.md](./spec/index.md)) found that
the accessible alternative real products ship is an action menu
listing destination columns, not arrow-key dragging.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from "vue";
import KanbanBoard from "@lilydesignsystem/vue-kanban-board";
import type { KanbanColumn, KanbanCard } from "@lilydesignsystem/vue-kanban-board";

const columns: KanbanColumn[] = [
  { id: "todo", title: "To Do" },
  { id: "doing", title: "In Progress", wipLimit: 3 },
  { id: "done", title: "Done" },
];

const cards = ref<KanbanCard[]>([
  { id: "1", columnId: "todo", title: "Design the empty state" },
  { id: "2", columnId: "doing", title: "Wire up the API" },
]);

function handleMove(cardId: string, toColumnId: string) {
  cards.value = cards.value.map((c) => (c.id === cardId ? { ...c, columnId: toColumnId } : c));
}
</script>

<template>
  <KanbanBoard
    label="Sprint 12 board"
    :columns="columns"
    :cards="cards"
    @move="handleMove"
    :labels="{
      cardCount: (count) => `${count} card${count === 1 ? '' : 's'}`,
      overLimit: (count, limit) => `Over limit: ${count} of ${limit}`,
      moveButton: (card) => `Move ${card.title}`,
      moveMenuLabel: 'Move to column',
      moveAnnouncement: (title, column) => `${title} moved to ${column}`,
    }"
  />
</template>
```

## Props

See [spec/index.md §5](./spec/index.md#5-props-and-events) for the
full table. Required: `label`, `columns`, `cards`. Every optional
`labels.*` field gates the control it names — omit a label and that
control simply doesn't render (no baked-in English fallback).

## Events

- `move(cardId, toColumnId)` — fires after a card moves, by pointer or
  by the move menu.

## Behaviour

- **Rectangular grid**: the body has as many rows as the largest
  column's card count; shorter columns pad with empty cells.
- **Card move — pointer**: native HTML5 drag-and-drop between columns.
- **Card move — keyboard**: Enter/Space on a focused card opens a
  "Move to…" listbox of destination columns — not arrow-key dragging.
- **WIP limits**: `column.wipLimit` triggers a warning state
  (`data-over-limit`) once a column's card count exceeds it.
- **Keyboard**: WAI-ARIA APG Grid roving-tabindex, the same model
  `data-grid` uses — arrows move within/across columns and clamp,
  Home/End jump within a column, Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End jump to the
  grid's ends.
- **Announcements**: every move announces via one `aria-live="polite"`
  region.

## Non-goals (v1)

Drag-preview/ghost-element rendering, virtualization, undo/redo,
column reordering, swimlanes, card selection/bulk-move, search/filter,
collapsible columns. See
[spec/index.md §9](./spec/index.md#9-non-goals) for why each is out.
