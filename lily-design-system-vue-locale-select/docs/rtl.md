# RTL — Right-to-left scripts, in practice

The select auto-detects right-to-left locales and writes
`dir="rtl"` to the document root. This page explains what gets
detected, what doesn't, and what `dir="rtl"` actually changes in
the browser.

## What's detected

Two signals trigger RTL:

### 1. RTL script subtag

If the locale string contains any of these as a `-`- or
`_`-separated component (case-insensitive), it's RTL — regardless
of the base language:

| Script | Code   | Used in                                |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Arabic | `Arab` | Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Uyghur, Sindhi, Kurdish (Sorani), Kashmiri, Pashto, Punjabi (Pakistan), Malay (traditional Jawi), … |
| Hebrew | `Hebr` | Hebrew, Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic          |
| Thaana | `Thaa` | Divehi (Maldivian)                     |
| Syriac | `Syrc` | Syriac, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic           |
| N'Ko   | `Nkoo` | Manding languages                      |
| Mongolian | `Mong` | Mongolian (traditional vertical) |
| Adlam  | `Adlm` | Fulfulde                               |

Example: `uz_Arab_AF` (Uzbek written in Arabic script, in
Afghanistan) → RTL.

### 2. RTL base-language subtag

If the first subtag (before the first `-` or `_`) is one of
these, it's RTL:

| Code | Language          |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| `ar` | Arabic            |
| `arc` | Aramaic          |
| `ckb` | Sorani (Central) Kurdish |
| `dv` | Divehi            |
| `fa` | Persian / Farsi   |
| `he` | Hebrew (current)  |
| `iw` | Hebrew (legacy)   |
| `ji` | Yiddish (legacy)  |
| `ks` | Kashmiri          |
| `ku` | Kurdish (umbrella) |
| `mzn` | Mazanderani      |
| `ps` | Pashto            |
| `sd` | Sindhi            |
| `ug` | Uyghur            |
| `ur` | Urdu              |
| `yi` | Yiddish (current) |

This catches the common cases (`ar`, `he`, `fa`) without
requiring the consumer to write `Arab` / `Hebr` script tags every
time.

## What's NOT detected

The detection deliberately stops short of consulting CLDR's full
likely-subtag tables. Cases the helper will get wrong:

- **Kurdish (Latin)** — `ku-Latn` (Kurmanji, written in Latin) is
  detected as RTL because `ku` is in the RTL set. If you serve
  Kurmanji speakers in Latin script, pass `:apply-dir="false"` and
  write `dir` yourself, or rename the locale to a script-explicit
  form like `kmr` (Northern Kurdish, ISO 639-3) which is not in
  the RTL set.
- **Punjabi (Arabic script)** — `pa-Arab` IS detected (via the
  `Arab` script subtag) but bare `pa` (which is Gurmukhi, LTR) is
  also correctly LTR.
- **Vertical scripts** — Mongolian (`Mong`) is traditional
  vertical Mongolian written top-to-bottom but with right-to-left
  column flow. Browsers treat `dir="rtl"` for `Mong` as an
  approximation, not as vertical writing mode. If you serve
  vertical Mongolian, use CSS `writing-mode: vertical-rl`
  yourself; the helper's `dir` is a best-effort line-flow hint.

## What `dir="rtl"` actually changes

When the browser sees `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` or an ancestor of
an element:

| Aspect             | Behaviour with `dir="rtl"`                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text direction     | Bidi base direction is RTL; weak characters resolve RTL. |
| Paragraph flow     | First line starts at the right edge.                    |
| Inline-axis        | `inline-start` is right, `inline-end` is left.          |
| Flexbox            | `flex-direction: row` flows right-to-left.              |
| Grid               | Columns flow right-to-left.                             |
| Scrollbar          | Vertical scrollbar appears on the left (some browsers). |
| Form controls      | Number inputs, dates, native selects mirror.            |
| Logical CSS        | `padding-inline-start`, `margin-inline-end`, `border-inline-start`, etc. swap to physical right/left. |
| Default text-align | `start` resolves to right; `end` resolves to left.       |

What `dir="rtl"` does NOT change:

- Physical CSS properties (`padding-left`, `text-align: left`).
  They still mean physical left, which is now the wrong side.
- Image / SVG mirroring. Browsers don't mirror raster or SVG
  content automatically; you do that with CSS `transform: scaleX(-1)`
  or by shipping a mirrored asset.
- Numbers and Latin-script names embedded in RTL text — these
  stay LTR within their bidi run (per Unicode Bidirectional
  Algorithm).

## Authoring CSS that survives both directions

Use logical properties throughout your CSS:

```css
/* Bad — breaks in RTL */
.banner {
    padding-left: 1rem;
    margin-right: 0.5rem;
    text-align: left;
}

/* Good — works in both */
.banner {
    padding-inline-start: 1rem;
    margin-inline-end: 0.5rem;
    text-align: start;
}
```

For chevrons, arrows, and "next/previous" iconography, either use
mirrored CSS:

```css
.next-icon {
    transform: scaleX(-1);
}

:dir(ltr) .next-icon {
    transform: none;
}
```

…or use a `:dir(rtl)` selector to swap the source asset.

## Mixing LTR and RTL on one page

The select's default rendering already does this: each `<option>`
carries its own `lang` attribute, so the browser's bidi
algorithm renders "Français" left-to-right and "العربية"
right-to-left within the same `<select>`.

If you embed user-supplied text whose language you don't know,
wrap it with a `<bdi>` element. `<bdi>` isolates a span from the
surrounding bidi context:

```vue
<p>Welcome, <bdi>{{ userName }}</bdi>!</p>
```

This is independent of the select, but it's the right tool for
username, place name, and similar untrusted text.

## When to opt out

Pass `:apply-dir="false"` when:

- You manage `dir` server-side and don't want the select to
  clobber it on hydration.
- You need vertical writing mode for Mongolian or traditional
  Chinese.
- Your design intentionally pins layout direction (e.g. a Hebrew
  marketing page that flows LTR for brand reasons).

The select still writes `lang` — only `dir` is suppressed.

## Testing RTL behaviour

Three approaches:

1. **Manual** — pick an RTL locale in the select and visually
   verify the layout mirrors. Check that no element overlaps, no
   text is cut off, and no chevron points the wrong way.
2. **DevTools** — Chrome's Rendering panel has "Emulate CSS media
   feature `prefers-reduced-data`" but no `dir`-toggle. Use the
   element panel to toggle `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` directly.
3. **Automated** — add a Playwright spec that flips the select
   and asserts `document.documentElement.dir === "rtl"` and (e.g.)
   that a visually-critical element's bounding box is on the right
   side of its parent.

## Vue-specific notes

### Reactive `dir` via `useHead`

When pre-resolving the locale server-side, write `dir` reactively
via Nuxt's `useHead`:

```ts
const direction = computed(() => (isRtlLocale(locale.value) ? "rtl" : "ltr"));
useHead({ htmlAttrs: { dir: direction } });
```

The select still writes `dir` on client-side mutation, but the
reactive `useHead` keeps the SSR markup in sync.

### `:dir()` selector in Vue scoped styles

`:dir(rtl)` works in Vue scoped styles the same as anywhere:

```vue
<style scoped>
.my-icon {
    transform: scaleX(-1);
}
:dir(ltr) .my-icon {
    transform: none;
}
</style>
```
