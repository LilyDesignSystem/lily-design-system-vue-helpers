# Install

This repository is the Vue 3 helpers catalog: five opinionated packages that each own one complete interaction.

It is published as a `git subtree` from the canonical Lily Design System™
monorepo at <https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system>. Issues and pull requests are handled there.

Full documentation and the searchable component catalog: <https://lilydesignsystem.github.io/>
