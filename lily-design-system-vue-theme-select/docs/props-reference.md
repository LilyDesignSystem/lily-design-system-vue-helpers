# Props reference

Field-by-field reference for every public prop. The contract is
owned by [`../spec/index.md`](../spec/index.md) §4; this file expands the
rationale and common usage.

## `label` — required, string

`aria-label` on the `<select>`. Always supplied, always
translatable. Screen readers announce it as the control's name.

## `placeholder` — optional, string — defaults to `label`

Text of the always-displayed placeholder option — the first
`<option>` in the select, which carries `value=""` and the
`.theme-select-placeholder` hook.

The `<select>`'s own value is pinned to this option: after every
change the component snaps `select.value` back to `""`, so the
closed control always reads the placeholder word rather than the
active theme name. That keeps the control as narrow as one word
instead of growing to fit the longest theme name.

Supply `placeholder` when the accessible name should be more
descriptive than the visible word:

```vue
<ThemeSelect label="Choose a colour theme" placeholder="Theme" ... />
```

The active theme still lives in `v-model:value` and in `data-theme`
on the target element — see
[accessibility.md](./accessibility.md) for how to surface it to
screen-reader users.

## `themesUrl` — required, string

Base URL of the directory the theme CSS files are served from. A
trailing `/` is appended automatically if missing, so both
`"/assets/themes/"` and `"/assets/themes"` work.

Acceptable values:

- Absolute path: `"/assets/themes/"` — recommended for in-app
  assets.
- Absolute URL: `"https://cdn.example.com/themes/"` — for
  CDN-hosted themes (CORS-permitting).
- Relative path: `"./themes/"` — works but depends on the current
  document base URL; not recommended for production.

## `themes` — required, string[]

The slugs of the themes the select exposes as options. The slug is
used both as the `<option>` `value` and as the URL path segment when
constructing the stylesheet href. Choose slugs that are safe URL
path segments — kebab-case ASCII is recommended.

## `value` — optional, string (v-model:value)

The active slug. Two-way bindable with `v-model:value` so the
surrounding code can read and write the selection.

When supplied as a non-empty string, the select treats it as the
authoritative initial value — `storageKey` and `defaultValue` are
both skipped on first mount.

```vue
<ThemeSelect v-model:value="theme" ... />
```

## `defaultValue` — optional, string

Used during initial-value resolution when `value` is empty and
nothing was stored. If `defaultValue` is itself empty, the resolver
falls back to `"light"` (when present in `themes`) and then to
`themes[0]`.

## `storageKey` — optional, string

`localStorage` key for persistence. When set, the select:

- Reads the stored slug during initial-value resolution.
- Writes the slug to storage after every successful apply.

Errors (private mode, quota, disabled storage) are silently
swallowed — the select continues to work in-memory.

## `name` — optional, string — defaults to `"theme"`

The `name` attribute on the `<select>`. It also serves as the
discriminator on the managed `<link>` element
(`data-lily-theme-select="{name}"`), so multiple selects can
coexist by giving each a distinct `name`.

## `extension` — optional, string — defaults to `".css"`

File extension appended to each slug when constructing the URL.
Pass `".css?v=2"` to bust a cached version, or `".module.css"` to
point at CSS-module-style files.

## `target` — optional, HTMLElement | null

Element that receives `data-theme` on each apply. Defaults to
`document.documentElement` (i.e. `<html>`). Pass a specific element
when you want themes scoped to a section of the page rather than
the whole document.

In Vue, the natural pattern is to use a template ref:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from "vue";
const section = ref<HTMLElement | null>(null);
</script>

<template>
    <section ref="section">
        <ThemeSelect
            label="Section theme"
            themes-url="/assets/themes/"
            :themes="['light', 'dark']"
            :target="section"
        />
    </section>
</template>
```

## `themeLabels` — optional, Record<string, string>

Per-slug display label override. When unset, default labels
title-case the slug: `"light"` → `"Light"`, `"abyss"` → `"Abyss"`.
Use `themeLabels` for i18n or for slugs that don't gracefully
title-case (e.g.
`"united-kingdom-national-health-service-england-for-patients"`).

## `class` — optional, string

Extra CSS class hook on the `<select>`. Always emitted after
`"theme-select"`, so consumer styles can use either selector.

## Default scoped slot

Custom rendering of the options. The slot receives:

```ts
type SlotArgs = {
    themes: string[];
    value: string;
    setTheme: (theme: string) => void;
    name: string;
    labelFor: (theme: string) => string;
};
```

See [custom-rendering.md](./custom-rendering.md) for patterns.

## Attribute fall-through

Any other attribute (`id`, `data-*`, `@click`, ARIA overrides) flows
to the root `<select>` via Vue's default `inheritAttrs: true`.
Use this to attach test IDs, analytics handlers, and overrides
without forking the component.
